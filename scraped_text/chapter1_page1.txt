Introduction
Welcome to the 🤗 Course!
This course will teach you about large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) using libraries from the
Hugging Face
ecosystem —
🤗 Transformers
,
🤗 Datasets
,
🤗 Tokenizers
, and
🤗 Accelerate
— as well as the
Hugging Face Hub
.
We’ll also cover libraries outside the Hugging Face ecosystem. These are amazing contributions to the AI community and incredibly useful tools.
It’s completely free and without ads.
Understanding NLP and LLMs
While this course was originally focused on NLP (Natural Language Processing), it has evolved to emphasize Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent the latest advancement in the field.
What’s the difference?
NLP (Natural Language Processing)
is the broader field focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP encompasses many techniques and tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation.
LLMs (Large Language Models)
are a powerful subset of NLP models characterized by their massive size, extensive training data, and ability to perform a wide range of language tasks with minimal task-specific training. Models like the Llama, GPT, or Claude series are examples of LLMs that have revolutionized what’s possible in NLP.
Throughout this course, you’ll learn about both traditional NLP concepts and cutting-edge LLM techniques, as understanding the foundations of NLP is crucial for working effectively with LLMs.
What to expect?
Here is a brief overview of the course:
Chapters 1 to 4 provide an introduction to the main concepts of the 🤗 Transformers library. By the end of this part of the course, you will be familiar with how Transformer models work and will know how to use a model from the
Hugging Face Hub
, fine-tune it on a dataset, and share your results on the Hub!
Chapters 5 to 8 teach the basics of 🤗 Datasets and 🤗 Tokenizers before diving into classic NLP tasks and LLM techniques. By the end of this part, you will be able to tackle the most common language processing challenges by yourself.
Chapter 9 goes beyond NLP to cover how to build and share demos of your models on the 🤗 Hub. By the end of this part, you will be ready to showcase your 🤗 Transformers application to the world!
Chapters 10 to 12 dive into advanced LLM topics like fine-tuning, curating high-quality datasets, and building reasoning models.
This course:
Requires a good knowledge of Python
Is better taken after an introductory deep learning course, such as
fast.ai’s
Practical Deep Learning for Coders
or one of the programs developed by
DeepLearning.AI
Does not expect prior
PyTorch
or
TensorFlow
knowledge, though some familiarity with either of those will help
After you’ve completed this course, we recommend checking out DeepLearning.AI’s
Natural Language Processing Specialization
, which covers a wide range of traditional NLP models like naive Bayes and LSTMs that are well worth knowing about!
Who are we?
About the authors:
Abubakar Abid
completed his PhD at Stanford in applied machine learning. During his PhD, he founded
Gradio
, an open-source Python library that has been used to build over 600,000 machine learning demos. Gradio was acquired by Hugging Face, which is where Abubakar now serves as a machine learning team lead.
Ben Burtenshaw
is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face. He completed his PhD in Natural Language Processing at the University of Antwerp, where he applied Transformer models to generate children stories for the purpose of improving literacy skills. Since then, he has focused on educational materials and tools for the wider community.
Matthew Carrigan
is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face. He lives in Dublin, Ireland and previously worked as an ML engineer at Parse.ly and before that as a post-doctoral researcher at Trinity College Dublin. He does not believe we’re going to get to AGI by scaling existing architectures, but has high hopes for robot immortality regardless.
Lysandre Debut
is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face and has been working on the 🤗 Transformers library since the very early development stages. His aim is to make NLP accessible for everyone by developing tools with a very simple API.
Sylvain Gugger
is a Research Engineer at Hugging Face and one of the core maintainers of the 🤗 Transformers library. Previously he was a Research Scientist at fast.ai, and he co-wrote
Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch
with Jeremy Howard. The main focus of his research is on making deep learning more accessible, by designing and improving techniques that allow models to train fast on limited resources.
Dawood Khan
is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face. He’s from NYC and graduated from New York University studying Computer Science. After working as an iOS Engineer for a few years, Dawood quit to start Gradio with his fellow co-founders. Gradio was eventually acquired by Hugging Face.
Merve Noyan
is a developer advocate at Hugging Face, working on developing tools and building content around them to democratize machine learning for everyone.
Lucile Saulnier
is a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, developing and supporting the use of open source tools. She is also actively involved in many research projects in the field of Natural Language Processing such as collaborative training and BigScience.
Lewis Tunstall
is a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, focused on developing open-source tools and making them accessible to the wider community. He is also a co-author of the O’Reilly book
Natural Language Processing with Transformers
.
Leandro von Werra
is a machine learning engineer in the open-source team at Hugging Face and also a co-author of the O’Reilly book
Natural Language Processing with Transformers
. He has several years of industry experience bringing NLP projects to production by working across the whole machine learning stack..
FAQ
Here are some answers to frequently asked questions:
Does taking this course lead to a certification?
Currently we do not have any certification for this course. However, we are working on a certification program for the Hugging Face ecosystem — stay tuned!
How much time should I spend on this course?
Each chapter in this course is designed to be completed in 1 week, with approximately 6-8 hours of work per week. However, you can take as much time as you need to complete the course.
Where can I ask a question if I have one?
